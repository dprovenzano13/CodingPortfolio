FSJS-Techdegree-Project-2
Data Pagination and Filtering

Project objective
  Without JavaScript, this page displays a long list of students. I have enhanced the usability of the page by using unobtrusive JavaScript to dynamically divide the list into "pages". Each 'page' now only displays 9 students at a time.

Features
  In addition to completing the basic requirements for this techdegree project, I also built additional features and functionality using JavaScript such as:

   Added a search feature to filter/find students
   Updated pagination results based on search
   Created fallback message for when no search results are available
